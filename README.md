# Information Retrieval for Question Answering 

In Question Answering, we are given text and a question refering to the text. The goal is to find the answer to the question in the text. We can find pretty good algorithms to achieve this task. However, they are performing poorly on long texts with multiple paragraphs. A solution to overcome this issue would be to use an other algorithm which would select the potiential paragraph most likely to contain the answer, and finally run the QA algorithm on it. This task should be quite fast for real life applications (several seconds maximum).
